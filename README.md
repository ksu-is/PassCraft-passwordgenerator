# PassCraft

#### This password generator allows the user to ask Python to create different types of passwords. This will have special characters, normal characters, and numbers to help create a strong password. 

#### I have found that making multiple passwords can save you a lot of trouble with the internet. I am dreaming that I will create a multiple password generator for this project that will give characters, numbers, capitalization, and other special characters on the keyboard. I am curious to create this multiple password generator because I hope it will give me security. The whole point of using different passwords for different accounts will help reduce the risk of one of my accounts being compromised. Having different passwords also means if one account is compromised, the other accounts won't, as they are unique.

#### The program will ask for user input about how long they want their random password to be and if they want any numbers or special characters in it. The program will give out a list of what you want in your password. For example, the menu shows if you want only letters, letters and numbers, or letters, numbers, and special characters.
